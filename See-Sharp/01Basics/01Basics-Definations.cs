// C# is a programming language but .NET is a framework.
// .NET can work with many languages like F#, C#, Python etc.
// .NET -> CLR(Common language library) & Class language

// When a C# code is compiled, it is first converted into IL Code (Intermediate Language Code) which is independent of the machine it is running.
// After this IL code is translated to native or machine code by CLR.
// CLR is an application that sits in the memory and translate the IL code into native. This process is called JIT(Just in time compilation) compilation.

//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// An application is made up of many class.
// Classes collaborate with each other at runtime which provided some functionality.

// Class -> Data & Methods
// Data -> Make, Model, Color
// Methods or Functions -> Start(), Move()

// Namespace -> A container for relative classes.

// Assembly(Dynamic linked library(DLL) or EXE) -> A container for related namespaces. This is a physical file on the disk.
